#  Doctor Appointment System

This is a full-stack Doctor Appointment System built with modern web technologies. It provides a seamless interface for **patients**, **doctors**, and an **admin** to manage healthcare appointments and user roles effectively.

##  Features

###  Doctor Panel
- Doctors can register with a **2-step form**:
  1. **Basic Registration** (email, password, etc.)
  2. **Doctor Profile Form** (experience, specialization, availability, etc.)
- After registration, doctors can access a dedicated **dashboard** to manage appointments and view patient information.

###  Patient Panel
- Patients can register and log in.
- They can **book appointments** with available doctors.
- Patient data is stored in a **Patient model** for future reference.
- After booking, patients can view their appointments and profile on their **personal dashboard**.

### 🛠️ Admin Panel
- Admin has access to a separate dashboard to **manage users**, **approve or reject doctors**, and oversee all platform activity.
